# Genetic Algorithm TSP
Implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem

### Instructions for compilation and running
* On the command line, enter `python3 genetic_algo_tsp.py mat-test.txt output-tour.txt 300` to run program.

### Limitations
* Since this uses a genetic algorithm, which is stochastic in nature, multiple runs may be required in order to get the optimal tour.
